Ozone Generator Project
This repository contains software developed to monitor and control a Chiller device, model HRR-012-W-20-MU, which is used alongside an ozone analyzer and generator for industrial purposes.

Description
The primary goal of this project is to provide both a user interface and backend functionality for managing and controlling the operations of the Chiller and ozone generator through RTU serial communications. This software has been developed using Windows Forms and the .NET Framework 4.7.2, optimized for Windows platforms.

Technologies Used
Windows Forms: For the user interface.
.NET Framework 4.7.2: As the development environment.
RTU Serial Communication: For communicating with industrial devices.
Usage
We are currently working on detailed documentation and a user manual, which will be included in this repository in future updates.
